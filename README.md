# NESemu
This is hopefully going to be a simple emulator of the NES console. 


Backlog:
    Wrapped up the olc6502 implementation.
    Added some of Bus, olc2C02 and Cartridge + Mappers.
    Began work on visual demo class.
    Next up:

    Need to write the olcDemo class and add some code in previous classes to be able to handle it (use GitHub of tutorial for reference).
